###  Hey there 👋 I'm Brian

#### About 🌏

I'm always looking for ways to make my projects more efficient and easier to use. Currently, I'm building operational infrastructure to scale [Bigo Live North America](https://bigo.tv)'s partner management efforts. I love building things fast, and learning as I go. Recently, I've been using [Redwood.js](https://redwoodjs.org/) & [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) because I am ***in love*** with the <u>developer experience</u> and how fast I can get a project up and running. I am also working on a couple music-tool side-projects in my free time. 🙂

Most recently at [Bigo Live](https://bigo.tv/), I've built various internal apps, portals, API integrations, and ETL pipelines between Hive -> Google Sheets. The majority of our data analysis is done in Google Sheets, with the exception of several [Connected Sheets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/connected-sheets) I've used to run & analyze millions of rows of data using BigQuery, as well as some fun image classification using Google's [Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision). Additionally, I integrated the AWS SDK into Google App Script so we could send mass emails using [Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/), while managing our contact list in Google Sheets where the majority of our team lived and worked.
